## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
### Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

### Cpp Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int lengthOfLongestSubstring(std::string s) {
    int indexList[255] ={0};
    int left = 0;
    int right = 0;
    int maxSize = 0;
    for (char val: s){
        
        right ++;
        if (indexList[val] != 0 && indexList[val] > left){
            left = indexList[val];
        }
        indexList[val] = right;
        if(maxSize < (right - left)){
            maxSize = (right - left);
        }
    }
    return maxSize;
}

int main(){
    std::string inputString = "abba";
    std::cout << lengthOfLongestSubstring(inputString);
    return 0;
}
```
